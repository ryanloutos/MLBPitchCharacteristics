                        <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            Both of us are baseball players here at WashU, and have always been passionate and interested in the game. 
                            Anytime we do a project together, our minds tend to go toward baseball related topics, as the game 
                            has gotten so analytical over recent years. Since around 2015, MLB baseball collects a ridiculous amount
                            of data for every game and every pitch thrown. There is public data on exactly how much a ball moves, how fast a player
                            sprints, the exact positions of players on the field, and much more. 
                        </div>
                        <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            &Tab; Also over the last few years, technological devices have come about that let players of all ages also collect 
                            very detailed data to make their development as a player more data driven. As pitchers, collecting this data using
                            these devices is super easy, but analysis is not. As more and more data is getting thrown at players, it makes it 
                            harder and harder to determine exactly what to do with it, and what are some next steps to take. 
                        </div>
                        <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            &Tab; We want to make analysis of this data easier, by creating a tool to allow pitches of all ages to compare their 
                            pitch characteristics with the guys in the MLB. This will make it easy for them to see how the best get hitters
                            out, and give them goals with offspeed pitches, locations, and usages that they can take into their development
                            and the game. We want to help players use the data to their advantage, instead of getting bombarded and overwhelmed.

                            The is a public Python package called pybaseball (https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball) which is a webscraper
                            that pulls all of the statcast data from public websites. This makes it easy to collect a large amount of data
                            so we can manipulate it how we want to.

                            Both of us are very proficient is Python, and will do most of our data maniupation and organization using Pandas
                            once all of the data is collected. The first step is to get all the pitches collected, and then we will need to
                            organize by pitcher and calculate any necessary statistics, averages, etc. With some basic data manipulation in 
                            Python, we will be able to get all of our data organized in .json or .csv form.

                            The jupyter notebook contained within the vis-data-collection folder of this project details how we ended up
                            collecting the data. We have 2 main data files, fastball_data.json and pitcher_data.json. fastball_data.json is
                            a much smaller subset of the data contained within pitcher_data.json. Its purpose it to allow rapid loading of key
                            information which we need to determine similarities between users and MLB pitchers. From there, once a comparison
                            has been selected, the full data set is grabbed from pitcher_data.json. It contains the performance of each
                            individual pitch, as well as pitch usage information for the pitcher over a season.

                            Our insights on this data came from examples on <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com">https://baseballsavant.mlb.com</a>. 
                            Here, the MLB stores and displays a lot of the current statistical information it records. It is, however, very dense and often
                            hard to gather information from if the user is not well versed in both baseball knowledge and the website.

                                                Included are an input box, a similar player selection box, and some rough sketches of diagram types, which are more clear
                                                later.

                                                Our second graphic design iteration attempts at clearly defining the elemnts though of in design 1. It includes an input box of defined
                                                characteristics and  a player selection based on various similarity metrics. The diagrams are a combined heat map and spray comparison
                                                between you and an mlb pitcher. There is also trickle down chart for pitch usage in different situation.

                                                their goals in a more accurate manner.

                                                advanced for our tools and the time frame allotted. It also is too complicated for a user to understand possibly. We believe that we
                                                can display the same information in a simpler fashion that is also more effective.

                                                This is our final graphic design iteration. It combines elements from all of the above iterations. From the vetted input characteristics, 
                                                to the similarity metrics calculations it is simpler and more comprehensive for the user. We chose the heatmap and trickle down charts because
                                                they demonstrate how the best of the best utilize their tools in a simple manner. The pitch usage by count is important as well because it defines
                                                the trends necessary to succeed no matter the competition level.

                                            The designs completed for milestone 1 focus mainly on a proof of concept. Our data analysis section is
                                            so intense that it dominated the time we would have used to refine the visualizations. What we managed to
                                            accomplish in this milestone is a demonstration of the data entry, user selection, and information distinction.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The data entry section was designed to limit user input to only necessary items, and to remove as much possibility
                                            of error as possible. Our player selection window thus populates based on similarity threshold which is at the moment
                                            rudimentary. However it does show that our concept is feasible.

                                            The actual visualizations are the movement profile display and the pitch usage display. The movement profile display
                                            attempts to show the range of tools with which this pitcher can be effective. Our goals for refining this are to
                                            include tooltips for precise information, as well as a polygon connectecting all of the points from the outside. The
                                            tooltip will display the information more precisely, and the polygon will further portray the range of weapons available.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The pitch usage chart attempts to show how MLB pitchers best usee their discussed weapons at different times. The colors represent
                                            different pitches, and the sizes of the pie-charts represent the frequency that the pitcher is in this situation. Our next iteration
                                            on this chart will have tooltips for the percentages of each pie chart, edge weights between nodes showing connections
                                            between counts, labels above different scenarios.

                                            In addition to these updates, we will need to display a global legend, as well as possibly some of the raw data which is
                                            best understood simply on its own.
