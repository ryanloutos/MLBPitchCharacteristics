                        <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            Both of us are baseball players here at WashU, and have always been passionate and interested in the game. 
                            Anytime we do a project together, our minds tend to go toward baseball related topics, as the game 
                            has gotten so analytical over recent years. Since around 2015, MLB baseball collects a ridiculous amount
                            of data for every game and every pitch thrown. There is public data on exactly how much a ball moves, how fast a player
                            sprints, the exact positions of players on the field, and much more. 
                        </div>
                        <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            &Tab; Also over the last few years, technological devices have come about that let players of all ages also collect 
                            very detailed data to make their development as a player more data driven. As pitchers, collecting this data using
                            these devices is super easy, but analysis is not. As more and more data is getting thrown at players, it makes it 
                            harder and harder to determine exactly what to do with it, and what are some next steps to take. 
                        </div>
                        <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            &Tab; We want to make analysis of this data easier, by creating a tool to allow pitches of all ages to compare their 
                            pitch characteristics with the guys in the MLB. This will make it easy for them to see how the best get hitters
                            out, and give them goals with offspeed pitches, locations, and usages that they can take into their development
                            and the game. We want to help players use the data to their advantage, instead of getting bombarded and overwhelmed.

                            The is a public Python package called pybaseball (https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball) which is a webscraper
                            that pulls all of the statcast data from public websites. This makes it easy to collect a large amount of data
                            so we can manipulate it how we want to.

                            Both of us are very proficient is Python, and will do most of our data maniupation and organization using Pandas
                            once all of the data is collected. The first step is to get all the pitches collected, and then we will need to
                            organize by pitcher and calculate any necessary statistics, averages, etc. With some basic data manipulation in 
                            Python, we will be able to get all of our data organized in .json or .csv form.

                                    This is our first graphic design iteration. It is a pretty rough sketch of what information we will eventually want to show.
                                    Included are an input box, a similar player selection box, and some rough sketches of diagram types, which are more clear
                                    later.

                                    Our second graphic design iteration attempts at clearly defining the elemnts though of in design 1. It includes an input box of defined
                                    characteristics and  a player selection based on various similarity metrics. The diagrams are a combined heat map and spray comparison
                                    between you and an mlb pitcher. There is also trickle down chart for pitch usage in different situation.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-6">
                                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/graphic_design_2.jpeg" alt="">

                                <p>
                                    This is a half improvement on the last itertion. It separates the heat map and spray charts. They are both easier to undersatnd and achieve
                                    their goals in a more accurate manner.
                                </p>

                                    This is our third graphic design iteration. It changes the combined spray into a 3d pitch characteristic diagram. This is too
                                    advanced for our tools and the time frame allotted. It also is too complicated for a user to understand possibly. We believe that we
                                    can display the same information in a simpler fashion that is also more effective.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                    This is our final graphic design iteration. It combines elements from all of the above iterations. From the vetted input characteristics, 
                                    to the similarity metrics calculations it is simpler and more comprehensive for the user. We chose the heatmap and trickle down charts because
                                    they demonstrate how the best of the best utilize their tools in a simple manner. The pitch usage by count is important as well because it defines
                                    the trends necessary to succeed no matter the competition level.
